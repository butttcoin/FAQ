# ButtCoin Version 2 FAQ (Constantly under construction)

## SNAPSHOT QUESTIONS:
### Where can I get my Version 2 tokens ?
1. If you held less than 100, go to https://multisender.app/merkle?ipfs=QmR6X4D1Dod9pmUwCTrmudoobayoWV1nhuA3Bzg2fxF7BG

2. If you held more than 25K, please send a personal message using Twitter, Telegram, or info@0xbutt.com, or 0xbutt@protonmail.com YOU MUST INCLUDE YOUR ETHEREUM ADDRESS!

3. If you held more than 100 and less than 25K, please follow the steps under #2.

### Why the second version ?
1. There was a bug and the token can be hacked. Nobody hacked it, and nobody knows how, but it does have a big hole in it !

2. It was the opportunity to improve the token and make it the best mine-able and the self-destructing token on a market !

### What was the bug about and how can I reproduce it ?
Lets just say that if you had the right skills, you could produce as many tokens as you like. here is the proof!

### What can I do with the old version, and is it safe ?
It is safe, the bug has been locked, and there is no guarantee that someone else will not be able to hack it. You can still trade it on a token.store https://token.store/eth/trade/0xBUTT

## EXCHANGES QUESTIONS
### Where is it listed ?
Currently, it is not listed anywhere. We are working on getting it listed on DDEX again. It will be on DDEX for a while.

### How many exchanges are you planning and why ?
For now, just DDEX. The reason is because more exchanges means lower trading volume per exchange. New exchanges are to be considered when safe to split the trading volume.

### Can I list the coin on other exchanges ?
No, and don't try, their addresses will be blacklisted and all of the tokens burned.

## MINING QUESTIONS:
### Is there a mining pool ?
1. Not yet.

### Can I mine the token ?
2. Yes, but please see the reward and include the 8 decimals. https://etherscan.io/token/0x5556d6a283fd18d71fd0c8b50d1211c5f842dbbc#readContract

### You mentioned multiple mining algorithms, how does that work ?

Simply, using the power of Solidity, we can create another contract that makes a call to original contract. This means that we can mine the second contract and get the rewards using the first contract. This also means that we can have as many mining algorithms working together as we want. We can also mine to burn!

## DESIGN QUESTIONS:
### What is the blacklist and why is it necessary ?
It is a security feature to prevent the scammers getting the unfair advantage from the token. Should any account become blacklisted, their tokens will burn as soon as they try to make a transaction.

### What is the rootAccess list and why is it necessary ?
This is to enable multiple contracts to "talk to each-other" and to give some privileges.

### What is the whitelist ?
Currently it doesn't have any value but it can be used in the future connecting the multiple contracts together.

### What is the lock ?
We can lock and unlock any function we want. If we had this feature with the version 1, there wouldn't be any need for the version 2. Also, we can override and lock the functions with other contracts. This is our solution to Ethereum's immutability!


## ROADMAP QUESTIONS:
### What is next for the ButtCoin ?
- Update the BitCoinTalk
- Update the WhitePaper
- Request the Etherscan to approve it
- Update the Webpage
- Request the DDEX re-listing
- Redo all the steps as listed on a /r/0xBUTT Reddit page
- Do a collaboration with SHUFF token to for a self-drop distribution
- Do a collaboration with Brapper token, so you can tip people the 0xBUTTs
- Make the mining pools for distributing the minted tokens
- Make the mining pools for mining the burned tokens

## AIRDROP QUESTIONS
### Will there be any airdops ?
No

### Why ?
Because the airdrop model does not work. It can do a lot of damage to a token.
